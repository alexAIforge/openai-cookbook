        "- Only set dates if they explicitly relate to the validity of the relationship described in the statement. Otherwise ignore the time mentioned.\n",

        "  1. Use ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSSSSZ) for datetimes.\n",

        "  4. Do not infer dates from related events or external knowledge. Only use dates that are directly stated to establish or change the relationship.\n",
        "  5. Convert relative times (e.g., “two weeks ago”) into absolute ISO 8601 datetimes based on the reference or publication timestamp.\n",
        "  6. If only a date is mentioned without a specific time, use 00:00:00 (midnight) for that date.\n",
        "  7. If only year or month is mentioned, use the start or end as appropriate at 00:00:00 e.g. do not select a random date if only the year is mentioned, use YYYY-01-01 or YYYY-12-31.\n",
        "  8. Always include the time zone offset (use Z for UTC if no specific time zone is mentioned).\n",
        "{% if inputs.get('quarter') and inputs.get('publication_date') %}\n",
        "  9. Assume that {{ inputs.quarter }} ends on {{ inputs.publication_date }} and infer dates for any Qx references from there.\n",
        "{% endif %}\n",
        "\n",
        "Statement Specific Rules:\n",
        "- when `statement_type` is **opinion** only valid_at must be set\n",
        "- when `statement_type` is **prediction** set its `invalid_at` to the **end of the prediction window** explicitly mentioned in the text.\n",

        "Before diving into Temporal Invalidation, we need to first tackle entity resolution. This process is crucial to ensure that each real-world entity has a single, authoritative representation, eliminating duplicates and maintaining data consistency. For instance, `AMD` and `Advanced Micro Devices` clearly refer to the same entity, so they should be represented under a unified canonical entity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's our approach to entity resolution:\n",
        "\n",
        "* We use the `EntityResolution` class to batch entities by type (`Entity.type`), which helps us make context-specific comparisons—like distinguishing companies from individuals.\n",
        "\n",
        "* To address noisy data effectively, we leverage [RapidFuzz](https://rapidfuzz.github.io/RapidFuzz/) to cluster entities based on name similarity. This method involves a simple, case-insensitive, punctuation-free comparison using a partial match ratio, allowing tolerance for minor typos and substring matches.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Within each fuzzy-matched cluster, we select the medoid—the entity most representative of the cluster based on overall similarity. This prevents bias toward the most frequently occurring or earliest listed entity. The medoid then serves as the initial canonical entity, providing a semantically meaningful representation of the group.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Before adding a new canonical entity, we cross-check the medoid against existing canonicals, considering both fuzzy matching and acronyms. For example, `Advanced Micro Devices Inc.` may yield `AMDI`, closely matching the acronym `AMD`. This step helps prevent unnecessary creation of duplicate canonical entities.\n",
        "\n",
        "* If a global match isn't found, the medoid becomes a new canonical entity, with all entities in the cluster linked to it via a resolved ID.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Finally, we perform an additional safeguard check to resolve potential acronym duplication across all canonical entities, ensuring thorough cleanup.\n",
        "\n",
        "To further enhance entity resolution, you could consider advanced techniques such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Using embedding-based similarity on `Entity.description` alongside `Entity.name`, improving disambiguation beyond simple text similarity.\n",
        "* Employing a large language model (LLM) to intelligently group entities under their canonical forms, enhancing accuracy through semantic understanding.\n"

        "We will define two prompts (one `system` and one `user`) for the initial planner.\n",
        "\n",
        "The most notable characteristic of our system prompt below is the use of 'persona-based' prompting. We prompt the LLM giving it a persona of an internal company expert. This helps to frame the tone of the model's response to the behaviour that we want - a direct, action-orientated task list that is fit for the financial industry.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is then extended in the user prompt, where we prepend the `user_question` with information on this specific situation and how the planner should handle it.\n",
        "\n",
        "In production settings you can super-charge this template by dynamically enriching the prompt before each call. You can inject information on the user's profile —sector, role, preferred writing style, prior conversation context—so the planner tailors its actions to their environment. You can also perform a quick “question-building” loop: have the assistant propose clarifying questions, gather the answers, and merge them back into the prompt so the planner starts with a well-scoped, information-rich request rather than a vague one.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another flow that can work well is to allow users to view the plan and optionally edit it before it is executed. This is particularly effective when your AI system is acting in more of an assistant role. Giving domain experts such as lawyers or pharmaceutical researchers the flexibility to steer and incorporate their ideas and research directions deeper into the system often has the dual benefit of improving both system performance and end user satisfaction."

        "\n",
        "In this context, 'fixed' tools refer to those with a rigid, well-defined functionality. Typically, these tools accept a limited number of specific arguments and perform clearly outlined tasks. For instance, a fixed tool might execute a simple query such as \"Get today's weather for the user's location.\" Due to their structured nature, these tools excel at performing consistent lookups or monitoring values within structured environments like ERP systems, regulatory frameworks, or dashboards. However, their rigidity limits flexibility, prompting users to often replace them with more dynamic, traditional data pipelines, particularly for continuous data streaming.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples of fixed tools in various industries include:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Finance**: *\"What's the current exchange rate from USD to EUR?\"*\n",
        "* **Pharmaceuticals**: *\"Retrieve the known adverse effects for Drug ABC.\"*\n",
        "* **Manufacturing**: *\"What was the defect rate for batch #42?\"*\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Free-form\n",
        "\n",
        "Free-form tools represent the most flexible end of the tool spectrum. These tools are capable of executing complex, open-ended tasks with minimal constraints on input structure. A common example is a code interpreter, capable of handling diverse analytical tasks. Although their flexibility offers substantial advantages, they can also introduce unpredictability and can be more challenging to optimize for consistent reliability.\n",
        "\n",
        "In industry applications, free-form tools can look like:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Finance**: *\"Backtest this momentum trading strategy using ETF price data over the past 10 years, and plot the Sharpe ratio distribution.\"*\n",
        "* **Automotive**: *\"Given this raw telemetry log, identify patterns that indicate early brake failure and simulate outcomes under various terrain conditions.\"*\n",
        "* **Pharmaceuticals**: *\"Create a pipeline that filters for statistically significant gene upregulation from this dataset, then run gene set enrichment analysis and generate a publication-ready figure.\"*\n",

        "\n",
        "#### Semi-structured Tools (used in this cookbook)\n",
        "\n",
        "Modern agentic workflows frequently require tools that effectively balance structure and flexibility. Semi-structured tools are designed specifically to manage this middle ground. They accept inputs in moderately complex formats—such as text fragments, JSON-like arguments, or small code snippets—and often embed basic reasoning, retrieval, or decision-making capabilities. These tools are ideal when tasks are well-defined but not entirely uniform, such as when the required dataset or service is known, but the query or expected output varies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Two common paradigms of semi-structured tools are:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Extended Capabilities**: Tools that function as specialized agents themselves, incorporating internal logic and analysis routines\n",
        "* **Flexible Argument Interfaces**: Tools permitting the LLM to pass expressive yet structured arguments, such as detailed queries, filters, or embedded functions\n",
        "\n",
        "Semi-structured tools are particularly valuable when:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Delegating specific yet non-trivial tasks (like searches, transformations, or summarizations) to specialized tools\n",
        "* The source data or APIs are known, but the results returned can be unpredictable\n",
        "\n",
        "In production environments, these tools are often preferable to free-form tools, like code interpreters, due to their enhanced reliability and performance. For instance, executing complex, multi-step queries against large Neo4j knowledge graphs is more reliable and efficient using optimized Cypher queries templated within semi-structured tools rather than generating each query from scratch.\n",
        "\n",
        "Industry applications of semi-structured tools include:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Finance**: *\"Extract all forward-looking risk factors from company filings for Q2 2023.\"*\n",
        "* **Automotive**: *\"Identify recurring electrical faults from maintenance logs across EV models launched after 2020.\"*\n",
        "* **Pharmaceuticals**: *\"Locate omics data supporting the hypothesis that a specific mRNA treatment effectively upregulates the IRS1 gene.\"*\n"

        "The `trend_analysis` tool is designed to compare how specific metrics or signals evolve over time—often across multiple companies and/or topics. It exposes a structured interface that lets the agent specify the time window, subject set, and target metric, then delegates the comparison logic to a specialised agent for handling this analysis. In this case we utilised o4-mini with high reasoning effort as this is a 'harder' anaysis task.\n",
        "\n",
        "This allows us to build a highly focused and optimised pipeline for dealing with comparison-style tasks. Whilst this could be built into the core orchestrator itself, it's often more manageable to split this into specialised tools so they can be more easily swapped out or updated later without much concern for impact on the wider system."

        "Additionally, RFT eliminates the necessity of providing labeled step-by-step trajectories. By supplying only the final correct answer, the system learns implicitly how to navigate the knowledge graph effectively. This feature is particularly valuable in real-world contexts where end users typically face time constraints and may struggle to curate the extensive sets of labeled examples (often numbering in the hundreds or thousands) required by traditional SFT methods."
